My own rendering engine made with Vulkan.

The engine is in a really early stage of development.

# Dependencies

# How to compile?
1. Download [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) and install it wherever you want.
2. Open the `EruptionEngine.sln` file  with Visual Studio 2022 and compile it by pressing `F11`.

# How to compile the shaders?
Enter the `Shaders` directory and run the `compile.bat` file.
