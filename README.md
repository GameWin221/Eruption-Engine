# Eruption-Engine
My own rendering engine made with Vulkan.

The engine is in a really early stage of development.

# Prerequisites
Vulkan SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows

# How to compile?
For now, you'll need to open the `EruptionEngine.sln` file with Visual Studio 2022 and just compile it there.

I'll add CMake later...
